# DropMe-android-app
I created this android app in 2017 as a project for my MSc course work.  
This is a ride sharing app in other words [car pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing).  
The concept behind this app is same as [blablacar](https://www.blablacar.com/) 
This app was designed to share ride in SriLanka.  
Android studio was used to design the UI and and Java is the progamming language
